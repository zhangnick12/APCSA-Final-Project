The proposed hotel reservation system will be a comprehensive management solution for hotel
operations, designed to accommodate all aspects from initial booking through final check-out
while maintaining customer relationships through a loyalty program (ex. Marriott Bonvoy).
This proposal outlines the core features, technical requirements, and implementation for the
system and each subsystem. The system will implement comprehensive management capabilities,
storing essential customer profiles that include personal information such as names, contact
details, and identification documents, including some requested services (ex. Dry Cleaning).
The system will maintain a detailed booking history for each customer and track their
points balance, payment information, current account balance, and special preferences or
requirements. For reservation management, the system will provide statuses for each room,
handle the booking process, and manage check-in and check-out times
(including requested late checkouts and/or early check-in).
It will also allow for customers to input their stay details to check for availability.
It will support multiple room types including single occupancy, double occupancy,
triple occupancy, and suites. Room and services management will be a key component,
tracking room status (ex. available, occupied, or under maintenance), handling room
assignments, and managing additional services. These services include television packages,
transportation arrangements, taxis, ubers, customizable meal plans, and room service requests.
The payment processing module will support multiple payment methods, handle deposits and cancellation
fees, process refunds when necessary, and generate detailed invoices for all transactions.
To encourage customer loyalty, the system will implement a comprehensive rewards program that
allows guests to earn points on stays and service usage. Customers can redeem these points for
future stays or services, and the system will track tier status for premium customers, enabling the
hotel to offer specialized services to its most valued guests. The technical implementation will
utilize various data structures to ensure efficient operation. These include arrays and ArrayLists
for storing customer and booking information, 2D arrays for room management organized by floor and
room number, and queues for managing service requests. This architecture will ensure optimal
performance and scalability of the system.
